Welcome! This is the third and hopefully final reboot that I do on my cryptopals project.

When this project is complete, it will be a python package that provides you access to some of the building blocks of cryptology. It will also be a Flask app that will use the package to (hopefully) teach you something about how the building blocks work and how they fit together.

[UPDATE] The website is live! https://cryptowithkoins.com

Both this package and the site are very much a work in progress, so if things aren't complete or don't look at that nice
I promise I'm working on it :)

Stay tuned!
