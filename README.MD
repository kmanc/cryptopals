Welcome! This is the third and hopefully final reboot that I do on my cryptopals project.

When this project is complete, it will be a python package that provides you access to some of the building blocks of cryptology. It will also be a Flask app that will use the package to (hopefully) teach you something about how the building blocks work and how they fit together.

Stay tuned!

[CAVEAT] - Although I provide functions that I built to perform encoding, encryption, decryption, hashing, and more, please
note the following when it comes to using this package. For any applications that need to be cryptographically sound, *please*
do not use cryptopals. This was designed to teach about the inner workings of cryptography and to perform some basic attacks
on older ciphers and is in no way, shape, or form adequate to actually protect anything sensitive!
