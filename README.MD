[UPDATE] The website is live! https://cryptowithkoins.com

Both this package and the site are very much a work in progress, so if things aren't complete or don't look at that nice
I promise I'm working on it :)

Stay tuned!

[CAVEAT] - Although I provide functions that I built to perform encoding, encryption, decryption, hashing, and more, please
note the following when it comes to using this package. For any applications that need to be cryptographically sound, *please*
do not use cryptopals. This was designed to teach about the inner workings of cryptography and to perform some basic attacks
on older ciphers and is in no way, shape, or form adequate to actually protect anything sensitive!
